# Wordly

 Recently played Wordle and saw how simple and addictive it was. So, I decided to create a clone, but since there are a million different clones, I thought I should try doing this the old fashioned way: on a command line. I found out the great react-ink library which basically serves as a react renderer for the command line, and this was the result.


## Quick start
Clone this repo and install the dependencies with
```bash
npm install
```
then, run

```bash
npm start
```
